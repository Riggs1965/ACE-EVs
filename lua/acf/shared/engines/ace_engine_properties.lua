--Fuel Density
ACF.FuelDensity = { --kg/liter
	Electric = 2.35 -- li-ion --WAS 3.1 , ACF-EV > to 2.35
}

ACF.Efficiency = { --how efficient various engine types are, higher is worse
	Electric = 0.6 --percent efficiency converting chemical kw into mechanical kw WAS 0.85 , ACF-EV > 0.78 (Still low to irl)
}
